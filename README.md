# Viking

Viking is a USB protocol for controlling the peripherals and IO pins of a microcontroller board for interfacing with external hardware.

It's designed for use with [Signalspec](https://signalspec.org), but is general-purpose and intended to be used with other languages like Rust and Python as well.

This repository provides the [specification](./docs/README.md), [design rationale](./docs/Design.md), and Rust reference implementation.
